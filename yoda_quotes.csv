Do or do not. There is no try.
Fear is the path to the dark side.
The greatest teacher, failure is.
Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
You must unlearn what you have learned.
In a dark place we find ourselves, and a little more knowledge lights our way.
Named must your fear be before banish it you can.
Size matters not. Judge me by my size, do you?
Wars not make one great.
Always pass on what you have learned.
Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter.
The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.
Adventure. Excitement. A Jedi craves not these things.
Patience you must have, my young Padawan.
Much to learn, you still have.
Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is.
A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.
When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not.
Control, control, you must learn control!
A Jedi’s strength flows from the Force.
The dark side clouds everything.
Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.
Many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.
Reckless is he who ignores the wisdom of the past.
Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.
Strong am I with the Force, but not that strong.
Twilight is upon me, and soon night must fall.
When you look at the dark side, careful you must be.
Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
Through the Force, things you will see.
Always two there are, no more, no less.
Lost a planet, Master Obi-Wan has. How embarrassing.
The boy you trained, gone he is, consumed by Darth Vader.
To answer power with power, the Jedi way this is not.
Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be.
Clouded this boy’s future is.
The shroud of the dark side has fallen.
Into exile I must go. Failed, I have.
If no mistake you have made, losing you are. A different game you should play.
Always in motion the future is.
Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force.
Mourn them do not. Miss them do not.
Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.
In the end, cowards are those who follow the dark side.
The Force will be with you, always.
Clear your mind must be, if you are to discover the real villains behind this plot.
To be Jedi is to face the truth, and choose.
Great warrior? Wars not make one great.
Lost, a Padawan may be, but found through patience they are.
Faith in the Force, never lose.
The shadow of fear is long. Step out of it, you must.
Calm your mind, and the answer you will find.
Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.
Harmony in all things, seek it you should.
Speak less, listen more, learn always.
Doubt leads to hesitation. Hesitation leads to failure.
What you seek inside yourself, find you will.
In the Force, balance you must keep.
The more you learn, the less you fear.
Great misfortune follows arrogance.
Powerful you have become, the dark side I sense in you.
You must confront Vader, then only a Jedi will you be.
Never too old to learn, one is.
To the dark side give in, and forever shall it rule you.
End your training, I will not.
Trust the Force, not your eyes.
Stronger than fear, hope must be.
In patience, wisdom is born.
Knowledge lights the path of a Jedi.
To understand others, first understand yourself.
Even the smallest being can alter the course of destiny.
Believe in what you cannot see, you must.
Let go of what was, and embrace what is.
To forgive, powerful it is.
Focused you must be, if success you are to find.
Fail you may, but learn you must.
Courage begins with faith.
To teach is to learn twice.
Listen to the Force, and trust it you must.
Fear not the future; live in the moment.
Strong with the Force you are, but reckless still.
Rest when you must, for even Jedi need balance.
A clear mind, sharp decisions it makes.
Too long you have looked to the horizon. Stay in the moment!
The galaxy, full of lessons it is.
The path to light, through darkness sometimes leads.
Only when you let go, will you see clearly.
Guide others, by your example you must.
The end, a beginning often is.
Truth you seek, within you it resides.
What you lose, the Force can return in another way.
Silent strength, greater than loud power it is.
Wisdom grows from stillness.
Trust in your training, you must.
Seek not power, but understanding.
Through failure, mastery comes.
A Jedi’s heart must be calm as the morning sun.
The Force binds all things; respect it you should.
Only the weak seek control over others.
When the lesson is learned, peace you will find.
To see the path ahead, close your eyes and feel.
In giving, true strength lies.
